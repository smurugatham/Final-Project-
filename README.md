# Final Project
In this project, we are going to see how to analyze air quality trends of New York State by looking at two main pollutants: PM2.5 and PM10 affecting the region in two years 2019 and 2020.
We would also see the effect of COVID-19 on the air quality levels for 2020.

This project is geared more towards research purposes in the field of environmental engineering by looking at  concentration levels and analysing different quantitative stat measures of these two pollutants. At the same time, we would also look at what Air Quality Index (AQI) is and how that can be a reliable indicator of how good or bad pollution is on a particular day.

Finally we would see if PM2.5 and PM10 affect urban communities more or rural communities and then identify which station produces the highest pollution levels in both urban and rural areas for both the years.

The required datasets can be downloaded from the INPUT folder.

# Inputs:
*   2019 PM2.5 dataset
*   2019 PM10 dataset
*   2020 PM2.5 dataset
*   2020 PM10 dataset

# Outputs:
*   Average daily max 8-hour CO Concentration
*   Descriptive Analysis of concentration
*   Air Quality Index (AQIs)
*   Air Quality index descriptive statistics
*   Urban vs Rural communities
*   Stations emitting most pollution

# Setup
In order to use the program, you have to clone/download this repository, navigate to the local directory and create a virtual environment with:

$ python3 -m venv venv
Then, activate the virtual environment:

For Linux/Mac OS:
$ source venv/bin/activate

For Windows:
> venv\Scripts\activate
Finally, install the required libraries for this program with:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to use the program

This is not a program where you have to input any classes or objects. Just running the program would give the results required for analysis and research purposes.
